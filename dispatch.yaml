# Dispatch allows us to route traffic from the default service to other services
# based on routes. This one lets all traffic go to the client service and if the path
# includes /api, it does to the api service
#
# You MUST run this after every deployment or routing will fail
dispatch:
  - url: '*/'
    service: client
  - url: '*/api/*'
